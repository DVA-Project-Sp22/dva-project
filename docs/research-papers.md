Talks about calculating the method for the wind energy potential in Spain.

[Where, when and how much wind is available? A provincial-scale wind resource assessment for China](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421514004078)

Talks about calculating the potential for wind energy in China. And the data sources they used and how they calculated it. Talks about land usage and various GIS data.

[Schwartz, M, George, R, and Elliott, D. The Use of Reanalysis Data for Wind Resource Assessment at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. United States: N. p., 1999. Web.](https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/7074)

Talks about NREL's efforts to do wind energy potential analysis. Everything talks about using models and GIS data, but I haven't found the models or the underlying data yet.
